  GArefl is a reflectometry fitting program in C which allows simultaneous
  fitting of neutron and X-ray data.

  The source software is available as a download from

       http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/reflpak

  or directly from the github repository:

       http://github.com/reflectometry/garefl

  Once you have downloaded the particular version you are
  interested in and extracted the files, change to the
  garefl subdirectory.

  The next step(s) are operating system specific.

  MacOSX

    Without magnetism (no fortran compiler required):

	./configure --disable-magnetic

    With magnetism (requires fortran compiler):

	./configure FLIBS=-lg2c         # g77 fortran compiler
        ./configure FLIBS=/usr/local/lib/libgfortran.a  # gfortran compiler

    You can install a fortran compiler from brew or ports, or download it from:

        http://r.research.att.com/tools

    Install gnuplot and aquaterm if you need plotting.


  Windows
    
    Install cygwin with dev tools (gcc, make, gfortran), or install msys+mingw.
    Install gnuplot for windows.

        ./configure


  Unix

    Install development environment (e.g., gcc, make, gfortran) using the
    package manager for the OS and install gnuplot.

	./configure


  Once configure has completed, use

	make

  to build the code.

  Next switch to examples/volfrac and type

	make
	./fit

  You should now be running an example of a simultaneous fit.

  See doc/ga_refl.pdf for instructions on setting up your models 
  and fitting with them.
